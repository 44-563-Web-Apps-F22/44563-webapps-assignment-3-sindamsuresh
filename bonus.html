    <p>
        Squirrels are generally small rodents with slender bodies, bushy tails and large eyes. In general, their fur is
        short, soft and silky, and ranges in thickness from species to species.It is often assumed that squirrels only
        eat nuts, but squirrels are actually omnivores, which means they like to eat plants and meat.In general,
        squirrels nest in tree cavities or build nests in tree branches during the warmer months. When it is colder,
        squirrels may live in tree holes.
