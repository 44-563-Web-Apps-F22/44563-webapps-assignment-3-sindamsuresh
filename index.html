            <p>
                The V&A is located in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, in an area known as "Albertopolis"
                because of its association with Prince Albert, the Albert Memorial and the major cultural institutions
                with which he was associated. These include the Natural History Museum, the <b>Science Museum</b>, the
                <b>Royal Albert Hall</b> and Imperial College London. The museum is a non-departmental public body
                sponsored by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. As with other national British
                museums, entrance is free.
